# YANFF - Yet Another Network Function Framework 

## What it is
YANFF is a set of libraries for creating and deploying cloud-native Network
Functions (NFs). It simplifies the creation of network functions without
sacrificing performance. 
* Higher level abstractions than DPDK. Using DPDK as a fast I/O engine for performance
* Go language: safety, productivity, performance, concurrency
* Network functions are application programs not virtual machines
* Built-in scheduler to auto-scale processing based on input traffic. Both up and down.

### Benefits:
* Easily leverage Intel hardware capabilities: multi-cores, AES-NI, CAT, QAT, DPDK
* 10x reduction in lines of code
* No need to be an expert network programmer to develop performant network function
* Similar performance with C/DPDK per box 
* No need to worry on elasticity - done automatically
* Take advantage of cloud native deployment: continuous delivery, micro-services, containers

### Feel the difference
Simple ACL based firewall
```Go
func main() {
	// Initialize YANFF library to use 8 cores max.   
	config := flow.Config{
		CPUCoresNumber: 8,
	}
	flow.SystemInit(&config)

	// Get filtering rules from access control file.
	L3Rules = packet.GetL3ACLFromORIG("Firewall.conf")

	// Receive packets from zero port. Receive queue will be added automatically.
	inputFlow := flow.SetReceiver(0)

	// Separate packet flow based on ACL.
	rejectFlow := flow.SetSeparator(inputFlow, L3Separator, nil)

	// Drop rejected packets.
	flow.SetStopper(rejectFlow)

	// Send accepted packets to first port. Send queue will be added automatically.
	flow.SetSender(inputFlow, 1)

	// Begin to process packets.
	flow.SystemStart()
}

// User defined function for separating packets
func L3Separator(currentPacket *packet.Packet, context flow.UserContext) bool {
	currentPacket.ParseL4()
	// Return whether packet is accepted or not. Based on ACL rules.
	return currentPacket.L3ACLPermit(L3Rules)
}
```

YANFF is an Open Source BSD licensed project that runs mostly in Linux user
land. The most recent patches and enhancements provided by the community are
available in the master branch.

## Getting YANFF

Use the **go get** command to download YANFF. You must first set your GOPATH

       export GOPATH=/my/local/directory
       go get -v -d github.com/intel-go/yanff

Go will download the sources into $GOPATH/src. It will try to build YANFF and
fail with a message:

        can't load package: package github.com/intel-go/yanff: no buildable Go source files in /localdisk/work/rscohn1/ws/yanff-test/src/github.com/intel-go/yanff

Ignore the message for now. We need to install some dependencies before you can
build.

### Working with a github fork

If you are working on a fork, then the **go get** command will not put yanff in
$GOPATH/src/github.com/intel-go. However, imports will continue to reference
githb.com/intel-go. This is a feature of Go and not a problem in the way yanff
is written. See [stackoverflow
article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14323872/using-forked-package-import-in-go)
for a discussion. A simple way to resolve the problem is to use a symlink. If
you are rscohn2 on github, and you forked yanff into your personal account,
then do this:

        cd $GOPATH/src/github.com
        mkdir intel-go
        cd intel-go
        ln -s ../rscohn2/yanff .

## Setting up the build and run environment

### DPDK
    
YANFF uses DPDK, so you must setup your system to build and run DPDK. See [System
Requirements in the DPDK Getting Started Guide for
Linux](http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/linux_gsg/sys_reqs.html) for more
information.

After building a DPDK driver with the make command, you must register network
cards to work with the DPDK driver, load necessary kernel modules, and bind
cards to the modules. See [Compiling the DPDK Target from
Source](http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/linux_gsg/build_dpdk.html) and [How to get
best performance with NICs on Intel
platforms](http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/linux_gsg/nic_perf_intel_platform.html)
in the DPDK Getting Started Guide for Linux for more information.

The kernel module, which is required for DPDK user-mode drivers, is built but
not installed into kernel directory. You can load it using the full path to the
module file:
$GOPATH/src/github.com/intel-go/yanff/test/dpdk/dpdk-17.08/x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/kmod/igb_uio.ko


### Go

Use Go version 1.9 or higher. To check the version of Go, do:

        go version
        
### Installing YANFF dependencies

        $GOPATH/src/github.com/intel-go/yanff/scripts/get-depends.sh

### environment variables
    
        export PATH="$PATH:$GOPATH"/bin
    
## Building YANFF

        cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/intel-go/yanff
        make -j8

## Running YANFF


## Documentation 

Use:
        make doc

to generate full documentation. Alternatively, you can do:

        godoc -http=:6060

and browse the following URLs:

* http://localhost:6060/pkg/yanff/flow/
* http://localhost:6060/pkg/yanff/packet/

## Tests

Invoking make in the top-level directory builds the testing framework and
examples. YANFF distributed tests are packaged inside of Docker container
images. There are also single node unit tests in some packages that you can
run using the command:

         make testing

### Docker images

To create Docker images on the local default target (either the default UNIX
socket in /var/run/docker.sock or whatever is defined in the DOCKER_HOST
variable), use the **make images** command.

To deploy Docker images for use in distributed testing, use the **make deploy**
command. This command requires two environment variables:

* YANFF_HOSTS="hostname1 hostname2 ... hostnameN"* - a list of all hostnames for deployed test Docker images
* DOCKER_PORT=2375* - the port number to connect to Docker daemons running on hosts in the YANFF_HOSTS variable

To delete generated images in the default Docker target, use the **make
clean-images** command.

### Running tests

After the Docker images are deployed on all test hosts, you can run distributed
network tests. The test framework is located in the test/main directory and
accepts a JSON file with a test specification. There are predefined configs for
performance and stability tests in the same directory. To run these tests,
change **hostname1** and **hostname2** to the hosts from the YANFF_HOSTS list
in these JSON files.

## Cleaning-up

To clean all generated binaries, use the **make clean** command.  To delete all
deployed images listed in YANFF_HOSTS, use the **make cleanall** command.

## Changing the DPDK sources

If you use the **make** command from YANFF directories, the DPDK driver is
downloaded automatically.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to YANFF, check our [Contributing
guide](https://github.com/intel-go/yanff/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). We also
recommend checking the 'janitorial' bugs in our list of open issues; these bugs
can be solved without an extensive knowledge of YANFF. We would love to help
you start contributing.
